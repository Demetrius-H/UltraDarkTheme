# UltraDark_BD
This is the README for the Ultra Dark theme.

Make sure the theme is set to 'dark' before using. If not, the theme will not work.

You can change any of the hex values if you choose. Just find the element you want to change, find out what class it is or what CSS variable it inherits, and change that in the file.

Enjoy! This is my first theme, and I will do my best to keep it regularly updated.
